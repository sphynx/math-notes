    "## How to build a tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "Concept of order is ubiquitous in mathematics and computer science, it permeates even the basic definitions. For example: what is a function from $X$ to $Y$? In set-theoretic terms it is some kind of relation between two sets (that has only one \"value\" for each \"argument\"). Then, what is a relation between two sets $X$ and $Y$? It is a subset of their Cartesian product $X \\times Y$ and Cartesian product of two sets is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "X \\times Y \\equiv \\{\\langle x, y \\rangle: x \\in X, y \\in Y\\}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "In words: it is a set of all ordered pairs with the first element taken from $X$ and the second - from $Y$. \n",
    "Here, we encounter for the first time the concept of an *ordered pair* or, as it is sometimes known, *a tuple*. I'll use those terms interchangeably. Also I'll denote tuples with angle brackets: $\\langle x, y \\rangle$ as it is quite common in set theory books.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that many important mathematical objects like relations or functions are (or can be) asymmetric, e.g. a function is defined *from* some set X *to* another set Y, those sets play different roles. The same goes about relations. Consider relation \"to be parent of\". Then \"Clara is a parent of Jack\" is not the same as \"Jack is a parent of Clara\". When we express relations or functions in terms of sets, we need a way to express this asymmetricity, we need ordered pairs."

Those strange properties do not convey any intended mathematical meaning, they are just \"side effects\" in a way. One can say that truly beautiful objects should only have properties required of them and nothing extra, that is why one may find those encodings unappealing. There are other ways of dealing with this situation, for example ordered pairs could be introduced axiomatically, as a separate primitive. There is a tradeoff between number of axioms and primitives one has to work with and certain artificial properties. As Paul Halmos puts it:\n",
